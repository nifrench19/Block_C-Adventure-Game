'''
this code is going to be something along the lines of what the shooting range is suppossed to do
the point of what this is suppossed to do is have the randomizers for the gun accuracy
and for it to have the user input for the gun accuracy.
there will be 5 different guns (kolibri, throwing knife, colt 1911, remington 11-87, and bow & arrow) 
and all of them will have a different accuracy which will be decided by the random numberoptions each gun has 
the larger the range of the number that has to be guessed the less accurate, and with each gun you only have 2 chances. 
in the end you need 3 targets hit in order to get the key which starts up the next code.
